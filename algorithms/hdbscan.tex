\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State Compute the \textit{mutual reachability distance} between all data points
\State Create the \textit{Mutual Reachability Graph} (MRG), a weighted graph with the data points as vertices, and an edge between any two points with weight equal to the mutual reachability distance of those points
\State Compute the \textit{Minimum Spanning Tree} (MST) of the MRG via \textit{Prim}'s algorithm
\State Convert the MST into an hierarchy of connected components
\State Condense the MST using the $min\_cluster\_size$ parameter
\State Compute the \textit{stability} of each cluster and extract a flat, non-overlapping partition, that maximises the sum of these stabilities.
